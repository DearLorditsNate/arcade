## Primary Functionalities of <em>JES</em>
- <strong>AJAX call:</strong> Pulls the value from the "search" term input and queries the mealdb API. The appropriate response object data is selected and then dynamically added as `data-attributes` to the `<a>` tag surrounding "Save to Favorites."

- <strong>POST request:</strong> When a user clicks 'Save to Favorites', jQuery selects pulls the data-attributes stored on the `<a>` link then sends that data as a POST request to be stored in the `Recipe` table.

- <strong>GET request</strong> - When a user logs in, all their saved recipes automatically appear on their Favorites page. This information is selected via their unique Firebase User ID from the `User` table.

- <strong>PUT Request </strong> - When a user adds comments to a saved recipe, the added comments are saved in the database. Upon reopening this saved recipe, they will be able to see all their comments!

- <strong>DELETE Request </strong> - A user has the ability to delete one of their favorite recipes.

- <strong>Input Validation</strong> - While minor at this time, if a user does not enter a search term, a notification will appear requesting they please enter a search term. 

### Future Development
- <strong>Multiplayer Games</strong> - Firebase user authentication provides a great framework to build in its Realtime Database functionalities to create games that could be played simultaneously in two user clients at the same time, against each other.

- <strong>Social Commenting and Sharing</strong>

- <strong>Mobile App</strong>

- <strong>More Games!</strong> - Frogger, Pong, and an RPG adventure game are all in the works.
